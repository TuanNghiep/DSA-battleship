### About Battleship
Battleship is a war-themed board game for two players in which the opponents try to guess the location of their opponent's warships and sink them. A paper and pencil version of the game dates back to World War I, but most people are familiar with the game through the plastic board game that was first marketed by the Milton Bradley Company in 1967. Since then, the game has spawned various video games and smartphone app variations. Today, the board game version is produced by Hasbro, the company that acquired Milton Bradley in 1984.

## GAME <a name="Game"></a> :rocket:
## Requirement for software:  

### Environment :computer:
Language: Java

Platform:   
IntelliJ IDEA  

### How to play:  
- Step 1: Place all octopus on the ocean grid, each octopus can be placed horizontally or vertically across grid spaces. You can use the ‚ÄúRandom‚Äù button to automatically place octopus on the grid, or ‚ÄúReset‚Äù button to reset all positions.
- Step 2: Press ‚ÄúFight‚Äù once you are done with placement. You cannot change the position of the octopuses after the game begins.
- Step 3: Player takes first turn firing shots (by calling out a grid coordinate) to attempt to hit the opponent's enemy octopuses. The game will call out if the shot is hit or miss. When you miss, the grid becomes empty and it's the computer's turn firing its shot. When you hit, the game marks that grid with an image of the body that got hit and gives you an extra turn each time you hit, until you hit all parts of the octopus, the game marks that octopus as destroyed.
